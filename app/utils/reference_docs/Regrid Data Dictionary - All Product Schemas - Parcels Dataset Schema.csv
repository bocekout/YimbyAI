The National Risk Rating is intended to help users better understand the natural hazard risk of their communities by providing a category range from “Very Low” to “Very High.” A ""No Rating"" designation does not equate to a null value. It typically means that the area has no measurable building, population, or agricultural value exposed to a specific hazard, or that the calculated annualized loss (EAL) for that hazard is zero.

housing_affordability_index,housing_af,numeric,✔,,,"Housing Affordability Index (HAI) measures the ability of a typical resident to purchase a home in the geographic area. The HAI has a base of 100, representing where the median income is sufficient to qualify for a loan on a median-valued home and not be cost-burdened (cost-burdened=greater than 30% of income spent on housing). HAI values > 100 indicate increasing affordability; HAI values < 100 indicate areas where homes are less affordable and median income might be insufficient to purchase a median-valued home.

This permits analysis of multiple growth rates between values measured at differing points in time using a common time period of twelve months; the annualized growth rate is repeated, or compounded, each year.
